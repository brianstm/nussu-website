      description={`The Exam Welfare Pack (EWP) is an initiative by NUSSU. This welfare pack serves as a form of motivation for students to put forth their best efforts during this tough and arduous exam period. The welfare pack will be distributed to the 10 major faculties within NUS for further distribution internally to the students. This year's EWP is inclusive of goods and items that are both essential and practical such as food, cosmetics and e-vouchers! The food comprises popular snacks and tidbits that are staples for any university student while the cosmetics includes products such as acne creams and skin care to help students cope through this stressful period. All in all, this initiative would serve as a great morale booster for the students in order to strive and achieve greater success in their academic endeavours, so as to end off this Academic Year on a high note.`}
