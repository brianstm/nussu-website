      description={`NUSSU RAG & Flag is one of NUS' biggest and most vibrant student projects. An annual flagship event, NUSSU RAG & Flag encourages the NUS community to contribute towards a charity-based endeavour, raising awareness and funds for the needy and less privileged. RAG & Flag consists of two components: Flag fundraising and Receiving-And-Giving (RAG) Day. Flag Day is one of the largest university fundraisers in Singapore, consisting of a wide array of fundraisers conducted by participating bodies from faculties, halls and residences of NUS. On top of that, approximately 2,000 flaggers will also be flagging at 100 locations across the nation with the aim to raise $300,000 for 21 beneficiaries from Community Chest. Aside from raising funds, students also engage with the beneficiaries and conduct activities to better understand their needs. Serving as the culmination of the entire RAG & Flag event, over 2,000 students from all faculties and NUS halls and residences put up performances on RAG Day to express their gratitude towards those who donated, as well as to celebrate the spirit of giving. This year, RAG Day will be held at NUS UTown Green on 8th August 2025.`}
